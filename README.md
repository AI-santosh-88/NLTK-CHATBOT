# TITLE: Streamlit NLTK Chatbot

## Description:
This project is a simple chatbot application built using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library and Streamlit framework. The chatbot responds to user inputs by matching them with predefined patterns and generating responses based on simple rule-based logic. It can provide answers about the bot's name, location, weather, health, sports, and more. The application is enhanced with a custom background image and custom text styles for a pleasant user interface.

## Responsibilities:
1.User Interaction: 
* The user interacts with the chatbot through a text input field, entering queries or statements.
2.Pattern Matching: 
* The chatbot uses regular expressions to match the user's input with predefined patterns in the pairs variable.
3.Generate Responses: 
* Based on the matched pattern, the chatbot responds with one of the predefined responses.
4.Customization: 
* The chatbot’s interface includes custom styles, including background images, and customizable text colors.
5.Exit Handling: 
*The user can end the conversation by typing "quit", prompting a goodbye message from the bot.

## Libraries:
1.Streamlit: 
* For building the interactive web interface.
2.NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): 
* For the chatbot's core functionality, handling pattern matching and creating simple conversational logic.
3.Base64: 
* For encoding an image and setting it as the background image for the app.
4.Regular Expressions (re):
* Used for pattern matching between user input and predefined responses.

## Summary:
* The Streamlit NLTK Chatbot is an interactive, rule-based chatbot application that uses NLTK’s Chat class to create a simple conversational agent. The chatbot recognizes various patterns in the user's input and responds accordingly. The app also allows customization of the user interface, including setting background images and text styles. It can handle basic queries such as asking about the bot’s name, location, or even weather conditions. The chatbot provides an intuitive way for users to interact with a conversational agent built using Python libraries.
